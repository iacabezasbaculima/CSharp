class: a oop construct to define a specific set of data
field: has no validation, often private
property: often public, can provide validation
??Validation: check if its correct, max/min/sign+- => in set part of property
method:  a function associated with a class, often its a verb. it has a body (implementation), parameters (argunments), return type (void, ...)
access modifier: public private protected internal
instance: object created from a class blueprint
constructor: a function used to create a new instance
abstraction: 
{
access private field via public property
middleware (part of application) authentication/validation
}
encapsulation: implemented by hiding data via access modifiers: often using private keyword
abstract class: class containing at least one abstract method
abstract method: function without body
interface: fully abstract class => a class implements IT
------
linear programming: scripting, top-down
compiler: high level C# => CIL intermediate => run with CLR 
assembly: compiled unit. Windows (exe) 
----
.sln: container where projects are kept in (holding container)
.csproj: metadata => library versions
------------------------------------------
action (delegate): method that has no return type, no paremeters
static: attached to class not to instance
linear programming: top-down, scripting

Threads: 
	- Synchronous programming: sequential execution of tasks 
	- Asynchronous programming: interleaved execution of tasks
		1. main thread
		2. background thread/task with resources allocated by operating system

		This technique is used for Web-based applications

Cache: temporary data stored in memory, web cache previously lodaded files
Buffer: temporary memory area for streaming data in/out
ASCII: 7 bits, 127 characters
UTF-8: 8 bits, 256 characters, web standard enconding
UTF-16: 16 bits, a lot of characters, to support special characters from different languages
Action delegate: void MyAction(); no in/out parameters, no data returned

					eg:/Customers/Index			Get all customers
					eg:/Customers/Index/2		Get customer 2
					eg:/Customers/Post			CREATE
					eg:/Customers/Post/2		UPDATE

					eg:/Customers/Delete/2		DELETE

Cookie: text file sent with every html request and response, it contains code which means something to the provider
